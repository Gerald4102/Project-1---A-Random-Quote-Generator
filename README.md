# Project-1---A-Random-Quote-Generator
 
This is the first project for submission for the Team Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

It contains four functions in the script.js file to fetch random quotes from an array, change the background colour of the page and aut-refresh with a new quote every 10 seconds. 

There are six quotes in the same script.js file. Each has an extra tag quote-property. Some have citiation and year-properties.
